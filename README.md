#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

Importance in the Technology Industry
    Efficient Systems: Software Engineering ensures that IT systems are efficient, allowing organizations to make the most of their technology investments. 
    Data Security: Software Engineering gives security measures to safeguard data against breaches, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
   Disaster Recovery:  Software Engineering contributes to disaster recovery planning and the development of backup and restore mechanisms. 
   Maintenance and Updates:  Software Engineering principles make tasks more manageable, reducing downtime and disruptions. 
   System Integration: Software Engineering helps in the seamless integration of hardware/software components, ensuring they work together harmoniously.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
         1.The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s)
       The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) marked a significant shift from machine-level and assembly languages. These languages allowed developers to write 
            code 
         that was more human-readable and easier to maintain, abstracting away much of the complexity of hardware.
             Impact: This milestone made software development more accessible and efficient, leading to the creation of more complex and sophisticated software systems. It also laid the groundwork for future 
              programming languages and paradigms.
      2.The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968):
        The term "software engineering" was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968, in response to the so-called "software crisis." This crisis was characterized by projects running over 
         budget 
       and schedule, poor software quality, and difficulties in managing large-scale software systems.
    Impact: The conference highlighted the need for disciplined, systematic approaches to software development. This led to the establishment of software engineering as a distinct discipline, with an emphasis on 
            methodologies, best practices, and the development of tools and techniques to improve software quality and project management.
    3.The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
       The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, marked a paradigm shift in software development. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasized iterative development, customer 
      collaboration, and responsiveness to change, contrasting with the more rigid, plan-driven approaches like the Waterfall model.
    Impact: Agile methodologies have revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility, continuous improvement, and close collaboration with stakeholders. This has led to faster delivery of high- 
         quality software, better alignment with customer needs, and improved team dynamics. Agile practices are now widely adopted across the industry.
 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
       Requirement Analysis – Gather and analyze user needs.
       Planning – Define scope, timelines, and resources.
       Design – Create architecture and UI/UX design.
       Implementation (Coding) – Write and develop the software.
       Testing – Check for bugs and issues.
       Deployment – Release the software for users.
       Maintenance – Provide updates and fixes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature	      Waterfall	                         Agile
Approach    	Sequential, step-by-step	      Iterative, flexible
Changes     	Hard to implement                changes	Allows continuous changes
Testing	     Done at the end	                Continuous testing
Example
Use Case   	Large, well-defined projects
            (e.g., banking software)	         Fast-changing projects (e.g., mobile apps)


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
          Software Develope:1.Engineers and stabilizes the product
                  2.Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
           Quality Assurance Engineer : 1.Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
                            2.Spots functional and non-functional defects
          Project Manager:1.Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
                2.Manages and motivates the software development team

Discuss the importan of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
            Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help programmers write and debug code efficiently.
                        Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
             Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes and enable collaboration.
                       Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
             Challenge:Changing requirements → Solution: Use Agile for flexibility.
            Challenge: Debugging and testing complexity → Solution: Implement automated testing.
            Challenge: Team communication issues → Solution: Use project management tools like Jira

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
                              Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., functions, classes).
                              Integration Testing – Ensures different components work together.
                               System Testing – Tests the entire application end-to-end.
                               Acceptance Testing – Validates that the software meets business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
                Prompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best,
                     possible output from a generative artificial intelligence model.
                  :It is crucial in guiding AI to generate relevant and accurate outputs.   
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 vague prompt :"Tell me about climate change"
 Improved prompt:Explain what is climate change and how it works
            Why is it better?
           1. You can Write something to get people excited
           2.you can explain how plants work
